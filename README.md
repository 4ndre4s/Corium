# Corium Programming Language
<h4>
Corium is a modern scripting language for all platforms.<br>
The goal is to have a safe, clean and easy to write scripting language,<br>
which is still very fast, so it can be used for AI, server or game development.<br>
The final features of the language are:<br><br>
 
* Easy to learn
* Clean syntax
* Safe, statically typed
* Test driven development
* Fast prototyping
* Parallel keyword for automatic parallelism
* Offload keyword for automatic GPGPU
* Cross-platform development
* Builtin formatter
* Builtin package installer
* Fast

The source code for the language parser is in the [Corium](https://github.com/MarioSieg/Corium/tree/master/Corium) directory.
